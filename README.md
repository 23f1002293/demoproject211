## Code Explanation

-   **`index.html`**: This single file contains all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    -   **HTML**: Structures the page with a main heading, a form (`<form id="essayForm">`), and a container (`<div id="essayContainer">`) where the essay will be rendered.
    -   **CSS**: A `<style>` block in the `<head>` provides basic styling for a clean, centered layout and improved readability.
    -   **JavaScript**: A `<script>` block at the end of the `<body>` handles the interactivity.
        -   It defines the complete essay text as a string variable.
        -   An event listener is attached to the form's `submit` event.
        -   When the form is submitted, `event.preventDefault()` is called to stop the page from reloading.
        -   The script then populates the `essayContainer`'s `innerHTML` with the essay text, making it visible to the user.
